        <h3 style={hStyle}>Source &amp; coverage</h3>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          Source data is published by the Department of Budget and Management. We track 40 numbered departments
          (codes 01–40), including five pseudo-departments that aggregate non-line-item appropriations:
          Automatic Appropriations (04), Budgetary Support to GOCCs (26), Allocation to LGUs (28), Unprogrammed
          Appropriations (35), and Other Executive Offices (36).
        </p>

        <h3 style={hStyle}>Units</h3>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          The source data is in <strong>thousands of pesos</strong>. We multiply by 1,000 at load time so every
          number on this site is in <strong>full pesos</strong>. The formatter renders ₱T / ₱B / ₱M / ₱K for
          legibility — “₱6.79T” means 6.79 trillion pesos.
        </p>

        <h3 style={hStyle}>Hierarchy</h3>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          Every appropriation lives in a strict 7-level UACS tree: Department → Agency → Program (FPAP) →
          Operating Unit → Fund → Expense Class → Object. The first six levels are stable enough to compare
          across years. The seventh — <strong>Object</strong> — was re-coded by DBM between 2025 and 2026;
          identical line items appear under different sub-object codes in the two years.{' '}
          <strong>Object-level YoY comparisons are unreliable</strong> without a hand-curated mapping.
        </p>

        <h3 style={hStyle}>Program renames</h3>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          Programs are renamed and restructured almost every fiscal year. Two examples:
        </p>
        <ul style={pStyle}>
          <li>The <em>Internal Revenue Allotment</em> (IRA) was renamed <em>National Tax Allotment</em> (NTA) in 2022.</li>
          <li>The Department of Public Works &amp; Highways flood-control portfolio shows roughly 1,446 FPAP renames over the period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          Per-department Portals merge programs by normalised name within bureau, producing a continuous
          series wherever rename was clean. Renames that also moved between bureaus, or split a program in two,
          remain split.
        </p>

        <h3 style={hStyle}>Items outside the GAA</h3>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          Some agencies are self-funded and do not appear in the GAA line items:
          PhilHealth, the Procurement Service of DBM (PS-DBM), the SEC, NEA, and TPB/TIEZA. Comparing
          their activity to GAA-funded peers requires separate financial statements.
        </p>

        <h3 style={hStyle}>Known data-quality flags</h3>
        <ul style={pStyle}>
          <li>~36 line items have department mislabels carried over from source.</li>
          <li>~25 line items report zero amount across all years and are excluded from totals.</li>
          <li>DAR (Department of Agrarian Reform) line items appear under Automatic Appropriations (04) due to source classification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style={hStyle}>AI-assisted compilation</h3>
        <p style={pStyle}>
          Aggregation, schema parsing, and editorial commentary were produced with help from Claude (Anthropic) — Opus 4.7, Opus 5, and Fable 5 —
          under human review. Always verify against the official GAA before citing.
